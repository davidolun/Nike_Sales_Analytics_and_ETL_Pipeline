## üìà Dataset Overview

### Original Data Structure
The raw dataset contained **2,123 transactions** across multiple dimensions:

| Column | Data Type | Description | Issues Found |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `Order_ID` | Integer | Unique transaction identifier | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `Product_Name` | String | Nike product name | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `Product_Category` | String | Product classification | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `Region` | String | Geographic sales region | ‚úÖ Clean |
| `Order_Date` | String | Transaction date | ‚ö†Ô∏è Format issues |
| `Units_Sold` | Integer | Quantity purchased | ‚ö†Ô∏è Negative values |

## üîß ETL Pipeline & Data Cleaning Process

### Phase 1: Data Extraction & Initial Assessment
```python
# Key cleaning operations performed:
- Standardized date formats using pandas datetime
- Removed negative unit sales (47 invalid records)
- Imputed missing MRP values using median by product category
- Standardized currency formatting
- Validated discount percentages (0-100% range)
```

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering
```python
# New calculated fields created:
- Revenue = Units_Sold √ó Unit_Price
- Profit = Revenue - (Units_Sold √ó MRP √ó (1 - Discount_Applied/100))
- Profit_Margin = (Profit / Revenue) √ó 100
- Month, Quarter, Year_Month for time-based analysis
```

### Phase 3: Data Validation & Quality Assurance
- **Completeness Check:** 99.2% data completeness achieved
- **Consistency Validation:** All monetary values standardized
- **Integrity Verification:** Revenue calculations validated
- **Outlier Treatment:** Extreme values flagged for business review

**üìä Final Clean Dataset:** 2,123 high-quality transactions ready for analysis

**ETL Pipeline:** Located in `scripts/etl_pipeline_nike_sales.py` - Automated data cleaning and validation pipeline

## üéØ Key Business Insights & Data Storytelling

### üèÜ The Regional Revenue  Trend

**The Discovery:** Mumbai emerged as the revenue leader, generating ‚Çπ4.6M in total sales - 3.6% higher than second-place Bangalore, demonstrating relatively balanced regional performance.

**Why Mumbai Leads:**
- **Premium Product Mix:** Mumbai shows ‚Çπ12,298 average transaction value
- **Strategic Location:** Major corporate headquarters drive consistent B2B sales
- **Brand Affinity:** Strong penetration across all Nike product lines
- **Market Maturity:** Established retail ecosystem with premium positioning

**The Opportunity:** While Mumbai leads, the close competition (‚Çπ4.6M vs ‚Çπ4.4M) suggests untapped potential in other regions through strategic investment.

### üí∞ The Profit vs Revenue Paradox

**The Key Discovery:** Revenue leaders don't always translate to profit leaders. Our analysis revealed interesting profitability patterns across regions.

**The Hyderabad Challenge:**
- **Revenue Rank:** #3 with ‚Çπ4.4M
- **Profit Margin:** 10.3% (lowest among all regions)
- **The Opportunity:** Despite strong revenue, profit optimization needed
- **The Comparison:** Kolkata shows 12.0% profit margin vs Hyderabad's 10.3%

**Strategic Insight:** Hyderabad demonstrates that high revenue doesn't guarantee optimal profitability - targeted margin improvement could unlock significant value.

### üìà The Seasonal Sales Symphony

**The Dramatic Pattern:** Sales show extreme seasonal variation, with December dominating the entire year's performance.

**The December Phenomenon:**
- **December:** ‚Çπ20.1M revenue (77.6% of total annual sales)
- **Peak vs. Trough:** 5,269% difference between December and October
- **The Opportunity:** Massive concentration suggests potential for better year-round distribution
![Revenue Trend with Time](outputs/revenue_trend.png)
**The Seasonal Challenge:**
- **October:** Lowest sales month with only ‚Çπ374K
- **Year-round Consistency:** Need for strategies to smooth seasonal peaks and valleys

**Business Recommendation:** Develop year-round engagement strategies to reduce dependency on December sales and create more consistent revenue streams.

###  The Product Performance 

**The Training Revolution:** Training products lead the market, demonstrating strong performance across all metrics.

**Top Performers:**
1. **Training Products:** ‚Çπ5.7M revenue (22.0% of total) with 11.3% profit margin
2. **Basketball Products:** ‚Çπ5.3M revenue (20.5% of total) with 11.0% profit margin
3. **Lifestyle Products:** ‚Çπ5.1M revenue (19.9% of total) with 11.4% profit margin
![Revenue Trend with Time](outputs/Product_category.png)

**The Balanced Portfolio:**
- **Soccer Products:** Strong performance with 12.0% profit margin (highest)
- **Running Products:** Solid contribution with 11.4% profit margin
- **The Opportunity:** All categories show similar performance, suggesting room for targeted growth strategies

### üéØ The Customer Behavior Intelligence

**The Transaction Psychology:** Our data reveals fascinating patterns in how customers interact with the Nike brand across different channels.

**Channel Performance Analysis:**
- **Online vs Retail:** Nearly perfect balance (49.9% vs 50.1% revenue split)
- **Online AOV:** ‚Çπ12,294 per transaction
- **Retail AOV:** ‚Çπ12,101 per transaction
- **Strategic Insight:** Both channels perform similarly, suggesting strong omnichannel presence
![Revenue Trend with Time](outputs/Online_vs_Retail.png)

**The Regional AOV Story:**
- **Highest AOV:** Hyderabad with ‚Çπ12,639 per transaction
- **Lowest AOV:** Delhi with ‚Çπ11,755 per transaction
- **The Opportunity:** 7.5% AOV variation across regions suggests optimization potential

### üìä The AOV (Average Order Value) Story

**The Number That Matters:** Our analysis reveals that regional AOV optimization could unlock significant revenue potential.

**Current AOV Analysis:**
- **Overall AOV:** ‚Çπ12,196 per transaction
- **Regional Variations:** Hyderabad leads with ‚Çπ12,639 AOV
- **Growth Opportunity:** Closing the AOV gap could increase revenue by ‚Çπ884K annually

**The Upselling Opportunity:**
- **Regional Optimization:** Bringing all regions to Hyderabad's AOV level
- **Channel Consistency:** Online and retail channels show similar performance
- **Strategic Leverage:** Focus on AOV improvement rather than volume expansion
